Training a chat model using BuddhiNLP is very easy and straight forward. We use JSON file format to input data for training the model. The JSON file structure is as follows;

```json
{
    "intents": [{
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day"],
            "responses": ["Hello, How are you?", "Good to see you", "Hi there, how can I help?"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "goodbye",
            "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
            "responses": ["See you later!", "Have a nice day", "Bye!"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "thanks",
            "patterns": ["Thanks", "Thank you", "That's helpful"],
            "responses": ["Your welcome!", "Any time!", "My pleasure"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "fallback",
            "patterns": [""],
            "responses": ["Sorry, please say that again", "Please give me more info", "I still can't understand that."]
        }
    ]
}
```


This is the format of JSON file that we use as the training data for the chatbot.

**tag:** _(string)_ This is the intent name. Use lowercase alpha-numeric characters and underscore. Do not use any other symbols or capital letters.

**patterns:** (_Array<string>_) This is where we defined user utterances. Patterns of speech for the intent. This is a string array. You can define many patterns as you like. More the patterns are better the accuracy is.

**responses:** (Array<string>) Here we define the responses for the intent. This is also a string array. You can define variety of responses. Try to define variety of responses, so the chatbot wonâ€™t keep repeating the same response.

Now to train the model use the following code:

```javascript
buddhi.train('path/to/file.json', output_dir);
```

### Parameters

**datafile:** Path to training data file.

**output_dir:** Path to out put folder where the model will be saved. Use _[__dirname](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_dirname)_ to save the model to the current directory of your project. Model files will be saved to this directory.
